# BlackJack Simulator READ.md
This is our READ.md file for our final project. We created a blackjack simulator.

# Rules of the game.
You can only bet multiples of 10, if you do not you will be propted to provide a valid input. 
Once you either beat the dealer or the dealer beats you, you will be asked whether you would like to continue play. 
You say "Yes" your winnings will carry over, otherwise, you will be thanked for playing and the game will finish. 

# Challenges
We really stuggled implementing the rules of Ace into our function. That definetly took the most time of of our entire project.
